# Chai Null

This is a addon plugin for the [chai](http://github.com/logicalparadox/chai) assertion library. It is simple implementation
of [Null Object Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) for Node.js and the browser.

## Installation

#### Node.js

      $ npm install chai-null

#### Browser

Include `chai-null.js` after including `chai.js`. 

```html
<script src="chai-null.js"></script>
```

## Plug In

If you are using `chai-null` in the browser, there is nothing you need to do. It will detect `chai` in the global
namespace and automagically get used.

If you are using node, here is a useful bit.

```js
var chai = require('chai')
  , nil = require('chai-null');

chai.use(nil);
```

## Building for the Browser

If you are developing an addon for chai, one thing you might find useful is the contents of the `support` folder.
This directly contains everything that is needed to package all js files in a directory for browser use. Provided
there are no external dependencies, everything will be packaged and wrapped with a CommonJS `require` style loader
by [folio](https://github.com/logicalparadox/folio), a small JS packaging tool. Please consult the comments in `support/compile.js`.

## Usage

#### Build object from scratch:

```js
var nullobject = chai.Null().method('foo').method('bar').create();
```

#### Build object with null properties and methods that just return null:

Class:

```js
var nullobject = chai.Null(Klass).create();
```

Object:

```js
var nullobject = chai.Null(obj).create();
```

## Tests

Tests are written using [mocha](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha).
Node tests can be executed using `make test`. Browser tests can be seen by opening `test/browser/index.html`.
